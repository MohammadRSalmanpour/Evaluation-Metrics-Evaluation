ArXiv link:  https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12032

## Background
Machine learning (ML) is foundational to numerous data-driven computational tasks. However, the consistency of ML evaluation metrics is challenged by varied implementations in Python, R, and Matlab, leading to potentially different outcomes. This study addresses the need for a unified standard and roadmap for ML evaluation metrics across these platforms.

## Method
In this work, we assess a comprehensive range of evaluation metrics across diverse ML tasks, including binary and multi-class classification, regression, clustering, correlation, statistical analysis, segmentation, and image-to-image translation (I2I). Our analysis utilizes real-world medical image datasets to compare metrics within Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions, aiming to evaluate metric consistency across environments.

## Conclusion
This study emphasizes the need for standardized evaluation metrics in ML to enable accurate and comparable results across tasks and platforms. We recommend future research prioritize consistent metrics for effective comparisons.


## Introduction
In machine learning, evaluation metrics play a critical role in assessing model performance. However, discrepancies arise when these metrics vary in different programming environments. This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of these metrics across Python, R, and Matlab, with the goal of establishing a standardized approach to ML performance assessment.

## Methodology
The study leverages real-world medical image datasets to compare and analyze ML evaluation metrics across Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions. Key metrics were analyzed for consistency across platforms, and results were categorized by type of ML task, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.

## Evaluation Metrics
A wide array of metrics was examined, categorized by ML tasks such as:
